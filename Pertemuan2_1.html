    <p>I am a Bachelor's degree student majoring in Information Systems at Telkom University. I have a strong interest in the fields of Information System Analysis and Design, Database Systems, Network and Computer Design. I have work experience as a Project-Based Virtual Intern: Digital Marketing at Home Credit Indonesia, where I learned extensively about content analysis, content creation, and key opinion leaders. I also gained insights into how Google Ads works, including its structure and campaign settings. I optimized visual content using relevant keywords, conducted research plans using KWHL Tables, and engaged in various other tasks.Furthermore, I have been actively involved in various organizational experiences. One notable experience was as a member of the Training and Public Lecture Division at EIM Laboratory, where I contributed to planning and scheduling training sessions and public lectures. I developed concepts and materials for training topics, established communication with moderators and speakers, defined participant targets, and more. I am actively seeking job opportunities that allow for further growth and development. I possess a strong aptitude for learning, adaptability, the ability to work under pressure, and readiness to be stationed wherever the company or institution requires. </p>
